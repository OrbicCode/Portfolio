## Design

This all began with the idea that I could take an image as inspiration and try to use that as the basis for a website. I had an idea for a Japanese-style zen garden ðŸª´ with a wooden porch ðŸªµ. I wanted to take the forest and moss greens ðŸŒ³, stone and slate greys ðŸ—¿ and brown-reddish wood to use as my colour palette. So to see the image come to life I generated a few with AI and came up with the image you see above.
