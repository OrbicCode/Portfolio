## Overview

### This is a challenge
Not only do I want to create an awesome-looking portfolio but, most importantly, I want to practice and learn while I engage with this project. 
From practising a mobile-first responsive design to including accessibility. Colour theory and UI fundamentals. Next.js, React and its components. 

### Pre-Project Questions and Thoughts

Can I capture a feeling, a place, or an aesthetic and translate that into a website? 🤔

Imagine taking a breath in a serene Japanese Zen garden 🪴 with slate grey stone tiles and bright grey gravel, meditating 🧘 on a dark brown wooden porch, surrounded by striking deep forest greens 🌲. The scent of incense merges with the natural early morning fog 🌫️ that permeates over damp moss-covered stones and into your being. Your ears tingle with the snaps and pops of the rain knocking on the leaves 🍂, stones and wooden beams.

Can I digitise that feeling and echo it when you're checking out my projects or leaving a comment on a blog post? 🧐

A lofty goal it seems. There is only one way to find out.
