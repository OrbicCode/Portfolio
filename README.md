## Design

This all began with the idea that I could take an image as inspiration and try to use that as the basis for a website. I had an idea for a Japanese-style zen garden 🪴 with a wooden porch 🪵. I wanted to take the forest and moss greens 🌳, stone and slate greys 🗿 and brown-reddish wood to use as my colour palette. So to see the image come to life, I generated a few with AI and came up with the image you see above.
