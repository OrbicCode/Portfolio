## Overview

### This is a test 
Not only do I want to create an awesome-looking portfolio but, most importantly, I want to practice and learn while I engage with this project. 
From practising mobile-first, responsive design to including accessibility. Colour theory and UI fundamentals. Next.js, React and its components. 
This will be a project to showcase my Front-End capabilities.

### Pre-Project Thoughts
I've always seen a modern house in a forest as a cool thing. With the black and slate grey in the middle of forest greens and browns. 
I've seen a few offices go for this look by having a plant-rich setting and including the same colours in their designs.

What if I can capture this aesthetic and put it into a website? Have this be my little cosy zen corner of the internet forest?
