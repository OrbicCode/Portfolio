## Overview

### This is a test 
Not only do I want to create an awesome-looking portfolio but, most importantly, I want to practice and learn while I engage with this project. 
From practising mobile-first, responsive design to including accessibility. Colour theory and UI fundamentals. Next.js, React and its components. 
This will be a project to showcase my Front-End capabilities.

### Pre-Project Thoughts
I've always seen a Japanese or modern house in a forest as a cool thing. With black and grey in the middle of forest greens and browns. 
A Japanese Zen garden. Wood browns and stone greys with deep greens from the plants all next to a clear stream gently flowing.
Why not have this be my little cosy zen corner of the internet forest?
Can I capture a feeling, an image and an aesthetic and translate that into a website?
A lofty goal it seems. There is only one way to find out.
